## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
A simple script to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion, built on 10 April 2025. It takes user input, handles basics, and reflects my beginner journey into algorithms.

## Why I Built This
- To master recursive function calls in Python.
- To practice user input and basic error handling.
- To tackle a classic math problem with code.

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does
- Asks for a number and computes its factorial (e.g., 5! = 120).
- Returns 1 for 0! and 1!, multiplies `n * recursion(n-1)` otherwise.
- Rejects negative numbers and non-integers with error messages.

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- How recursion works with base cases (0! = 1, 1! = 1).
- Using `try-except` to catch invalid inputs.
- Adding simple input validation with `if` statements.
- The limits of recursion (stack overflow risk).

---

## ðŸ”„ Updates
- âœ… Created a recursive factorial function.
- âœ… Added user input with `try-except` for non-integers.
- âœ… Implemented negative number check.

## Development Notes
- Uses pure Python (no libraries).

## NOTE
- README crafted with AI chatbot assistance.
- Kept raw to document my learningâ€”plan to refine later.
