# Recursion Factorial Script (Beginner Edition) - April 2025

## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
An updated script to calculate factorial using recursion, built in April 2025. It features a loop for multiple attempts, a 1-100 range, and user continuation, improving on my earlier version.

## Why I Built This
- To implement a recursive factorial with a loop.
- To practice user input, validation, and flow control.
- To enhance interactivity in my coding journey.

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does
- Computes factorial (e.g., 5! = 120) recursively.
- Accepts input between 1-100, loops until user quits or errors.
- Rejects negatives, warns about >100, and asks "yes/no" to continue.

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Using `while True` for repeated input.
- Adding user choice (yes/no) to control flow.
- Managing recursion limits and error handling.

---

## ðŸ”„ Updates
- âœ… Added a `while` loop for multiple attempts.
- âœ… Implemented yes/no continuation prompt.
- âœ… Maintained 1-100 range with overflow warning.
